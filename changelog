Version 2.02

    WFS now checks the maximum latency as specfied in miliseconds. If this
    threshold is exceeded, a failover is performed. This may be useful for
    setups where the latency of a connection is as important as the connection
    itself. Low latency connections for VOIP for example.

Version 2.01

    WFS permits the user to execute (external) commands when a failover
    or restore event occurs. This feature did not work properly and has
    been fixed within this version. You can specify commands to be executed
    within the config file. Consult the manual for additional information.

Version 2.0

Initial release of the 2.x branch.
